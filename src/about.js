    <h2>Tradition served with every bloom. ðŸŒ¸</h2>
    <p>
      At Hanami, we celebrate the beauty of tradition much like the fleeting blossoms 
      our name is inspired by. Our kitchen brings together the culinary heritage of 
      <strong>Japan, Korea, and China</strong>, each recipe prepared with care and authenticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the warmth of a shared meal to the joy of raising a glass, Hanami offers two experiences: 
      our <em>Restaurant</em>, where timeless dishes are served with respect for tradition, and 
      our <em>Bar</em>, where the art of East Asian drinks meets modern creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether youâ€™re starting with delicate dumplings, savoring a hearty noodle bowl, 
      or enjoying a glass of sake or soju among friends, Hanami is more than dining â€” 
      itâ€™s a moment to pause, connect, and savor lifeâ€™s flavors together.
    </p>
